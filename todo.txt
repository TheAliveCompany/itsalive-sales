# itsalive.co - Todo List

NOTE: These are discussion items - let's talk through them together rather than just diving in.

## Vision
The defacto platform for vibe-coded apps. Zero friction. No external API keys.
Deploy and everything just works - auth, database, AI, email, payments, stats.

## Priority - Foundation
- [ ] Solidify DB permissions model (creator owns their docs, public read option?)
- [ ] Solidify auth (session length, OAuth options later?)
- [ ] Usage metering infrastructure (track everything for billing + stats)
- [ ] Stats dashboard for users (visitors, API calls, storage, etc.)
- [ ] Billing infrastructure (Stripe integration, usage-based billing)

## Priority - Services to Proxy
- [ ] AI API - proxy to Claude/OpenAI, user just calls us, we bill them
- [ ] Email sending - expose Resend to user apps (already have it for ourselves)
- [ ] Payments - Stripe proxy so users can accept payments without their own Stripe account

## Priority - Business
- [ ] Security review - full audit before scaling
- [ ] Upgrade flow - how users move from Free → Pro → Studio

## Features by Tier
| Feature | Free | Pro | Studio |
|---------|------|-----|--------|
| Hosting | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Auth | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Database | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Stats dashboard | Basic | Full | Full |
| AI API | Pay per use | Pay per use | Pay per use |
| Email sending | 100/day | 1000/day | 10000/day |
| Custom domain | - | ✓ | ✓ |
| Staging env | - | ✓ | ✓ |
| White-label subdomain | - | - | ✓ |
| Sites | 10 | 1 per $50 | 100 |

## Other Ideas
- [ ] Create `apps` table in D1 for tracking deployed sites
- [ ] Custom domain support (DNS instructions, SSL)
- [ ] Docker/npm - more complex app deployments (future)

### CLI Improvements
- [ ] Add `--reset` flag to clear .itsalive config
- [ ] Add `--info` flag to show current config
- [ ] Add `--watch` mode for dev (auto-deploy on changes)

### Documentation
- [ ] Update ITSALIVE.md with AI/email/stats API examples
- [ ] Common patterns and examples for Claude
